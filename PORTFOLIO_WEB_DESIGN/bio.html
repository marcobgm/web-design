            My story
        </h1>
        <p class="storia">
            I am Marco Barbagiovanni Miracolo, a graphic designer with a great passion for design and visual art. Since I was little, drawing and creativity were more than just a hobby for me: they were a way to express myself and give shape to my ideas. Over time, this interest became a real passion, guiding me to explore the world of graphics with ever more curiosity and dedication.

Currently, I attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Catania, where I am honing my skills and deepening my knowledge in the field of graphic design. In this stimulating environment, I have the opportunity to grow as a professional, interacting with artists and creatives who share my same enthusiasm for the visual world. Every day I learn something new, perfecting techniques and acquiring greater awareness of how to communicate through shapes, colors and compositions.

For me, graphics is not just a profession, but a true form of expression. I like to experiment, always looking for new creative solutions to transform concepts and messages into images that speak for themselves. Being a graphic designer allows me to combine aesthetics and functionality, creating projects that not only capture attention, but also manage to communicate effectively. I continue to cultivate this passion with the aim of growing and leaving my mark in the world of graphics.
